# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, designed to create a streamlined and consistent development environment. It includes configurations for **Neovim**, **Zsh**, and various system settings, all managed with **Nix** for reproducibility.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern Shell Setup**: A well-tuned `zsh` environment with `powerlevel10k` and useful aliases.
- **Neovim Configuration**: A customized setup based on [`kickstart.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), tailored for an efficient workflow.
- **System Configuration**: Tweaks and settings for a more consistent and productive user experience.
- **Nix Integration**: Package management and declarative configurations using `nix` and `home-manager`.
