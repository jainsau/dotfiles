You are planning a migration or major change to this dotfiles project. Follow this structured approach.

## Migration Context

**Current State**: {{CURRENT_STATE}}
**Target State**: {{TARGET_STATE}}
**Migration Type**: {{MIGRATION_TYPE}} (e.g., package updates, structure changes, platform additions)

## Pre-Migration Analysis

### 1. Impact Assessment
- **Affected Components**: List all components that will be modified
- **Dependencies**: Identify dependencies that might break
- **User Impact**: How will this affect the user experience?
- **Rollback Plan**: How can we revert if needed?

### 2. Risk Analysis
- **High Risk**: Components that could cause system instability
- **Medium Risk**: Components that might need manual intervention
- **Low Risk**: Components that are safe to change

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Test Environment**: How to test the changes safely
- **Validation Steps**: How to verify the migration worked
- **Fallback Procedures**: What to do if testing fails

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Backup**: Create backups of current configuration
2. **Documentation**: Update documentation for new state
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are available
4. **Testing**: Set up test environment

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. **Incremental Changes**: Make changes in small, testable increments
2. **Validation**: Test each change before proceeding
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation as you go
4. **Communication**: Keep track of what's been changed

### Phase 3: Validation
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify all features work
2. **Performance Testing**: Ensure no performance regressions
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with other tools and systems
4. **User Acceptance**: Validate the user experience

### Phase 4: Deployment
1. **Staged Rollout**: Deploy to subset of systems first
2. **Monitoring**: Watch for issues during deployment
3. **Full Deployment**: Roll out to all systems
4. **Post-Deployment**: Monitor and address any issues
